> **failed interview → took break → came back stronger → building Bitcoin/Blockchain projects only**

## mission: 

i'm tired of building TODO apps. i'm becoming a **Bitcoin backend developer** by building real projects that solve real problems.

**why Bitcoin?** because it's only money which is fair and it's the future.

##  my story

**february 2025:** failed backend interview, lost motivation.  
**march - December 2025:** took a break and studied Bitcoin.  
**january 2026:** decided to come back stronger, building in public.

**why i'll succeed this time:**
1. building portfolio that stands out (Bitcoin > TODO/e commerce bs apps)
2. documenting everything (learning in public)
3. shipping real, deployed projects (not just code)
4. obsessed with mastery, not just employment
